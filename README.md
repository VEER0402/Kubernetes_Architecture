🚀 What is Kubernetes?


Kubernetes (K8s) is a container orchestration system.

In simple words:

A system that runs your containers automatically, heals them, scales them, and distributes traffic.

Kubernetes works on a cluster, which means:

A group of machines working together as ONE system.

These machines are divided into two parts:

Control Plane (Brain)

Worker Nodes (Hands that do the work)




🧠 Kubernetes Architecture
